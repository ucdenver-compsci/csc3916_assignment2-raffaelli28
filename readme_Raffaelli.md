Please find attached my Postman link.

Also, please note that I have been getting some error emails about the authorization variable I made and it kept on deleting it.

# I have modified my previous postman link because it was not done properly and I have asked the instructor if I may resubmit my HW, and I have received an approval.


# I was asked to update the Postman Link, please find attached the new Run in Postman Link:
